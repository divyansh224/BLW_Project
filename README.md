## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine (which includes npm).

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/divyansh224/BLW_Project.git](https://github.com/divyansh224/BLW_Project.git)
    cd BLW_Project
    ```

2.  **Set up the Backend:**
    * Navigate to the backend directory:
        ```sh
        cd blw_ams_backend
        ```
    * Install the required npm packages:
        ```sh
        npm install
        ```
    * (Optional) Seed the database with initial data. This will create the `blw.db` file and populate it.
        ```sh
        node seedInventory.js
        ```
    * Start the backend server:
        ```sh
        node server.js
        ```
    The backend server will be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

3.  **Set up the Frontend:**
    * The frontend is composed of static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files located in the `blw_ams_frontend` directory.
    * No separate installation is needed. The backend server is already configured to serve these files.
